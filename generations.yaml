    description: "The Audi Q2 is the brand's smallest SUV, introduced to target the growing urban compact crossover segment. Built on the Volkswagen Group MQB platform, it features distinctive styling with a polygon design theme and the option for contrasting C-pillar 'blades' in different colors. Despite its compact dimensions, the Q2 maintains Audi's premium interior quality with available Virtual Cockpit digital instruments and advanced infotainment systems. Engine options include three and four-cylinder TFSI petrol and TDI diesel units, with front-wheel drive standard and quattro all-wheel drive available on higher-powered variants. A facelift in 2020 refreshed the exterior design and updated the technology offerings. The Q2 represents Audi's approach to creating premium vehicles in smaller segments, offering distinctive styling and advanced technology in a compact package."
